\title{Apply function for water year}
\usage{
apply.wyearly(x, FUN, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{xts vector to calculate FUN for}

\item{FUN}{the function to be applied}

\item{...}{optional arguments to FUN}
}
\description{
apply.wyearly calculates a function FUN for the periods defined by the water
year, similar to other functions of the form apply.<time period>, for
example apply.daily, apply.monthly, etc. This is a function especially
helpful to hydrology data or results. The assumed water year start is
October 1st.
}
\details{
The function assumes an October 1st start to the water year. If the data
supplied is from, e.g. 2008-10-01 to 2009-09-30, the function will use the
September 30th date as the final day to apply the function for the water
year.

Note that currently the water year calculation is done from Oct 2 to Oct 1st
(or September 30th) inclusive. For example in the Oct 1 2007 to Oct 1 2008
water year, the end date is shown as "2008-10-01", and the function will be
evaluated for the period 2007-10-02 - 2008-10-01, inclusive.

The apply.wyearly function applies to only one column at a time, otherwise
only the first column will be used, with a warning.
